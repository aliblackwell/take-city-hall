            <p>Take City Hall is a one-day event that will take place on Saturday 5th September. This is your opportunity to get involved!  We need members and supporters of the London Green Party to build the #GREENSURGE into a progressive movement for London: connected to London-wide social and environmental campaigns, championing anti-austerity policies and prepared to fight a campaign that could see our Green Party Mayoral candidate and London Assembly list elected to City Hall in 2016. </p>

            <p>Since the #GREENSURGE the Green Party in London has never been bigger.  We have watched while all around the world progressive social movements have fought alongside communities and won electoral power.  Now it is our turn.  The other parties are in chaos, all reading from the same anti-austerity script while a progressive London that looks towards the future is ready to elect a progressive City Hall.  The #GREENSURGE has put us in a strong position to build a London Mayoral and Assembly List campaign that enables you to get involved in your London community - taking action on issues that matter to you.  </p>

        <h2 class="tk-bebas-neue">FAQs</h2>
        <div class="ui grid">
          <div class="four wide column"></div>
          <div class="twelve wide column">
            <dl>
              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">What is City Hall and why is it important?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>City Hall is the home of the Greater London Authority - London's government. The Mayor (currently Boris Johnson) has powers over London's transport, housing policy, policing and other vital areas. </p>
                <p>City Hall's 25 Assembly Members hold the Mayor to account. They oversee the Mayor's major projects, approve the budget, and sit on decision-making committees. </p>
                <p>Most importantly, they represent Londoners, address the issues that concern them, and work to improve life in the capital.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/London%20Assembly%20–%20Standing%20up%20for%20London%20Booklet.pdf" target="new">You can find out more about their work.</a> </p>

              </dd>
              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">Who are the London Assembly list? </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Of the 25 Assembly Members, 14 are elected on a constituency basis (each constituency is several Parliamentary constituencies grouped together), and 11 are elected on a Londonwide, proportional representation basis: these are the 'List' Assembly Members. </p>

                <p>Our 'London Assembly List' is the list of 11 people selected by London Green Party members to gain seats in the London Assembly. The List is ranked in order of votes, with the person at the top of the List being the one with most votes, and so on, down to 11. </p>

                <p>The number of seats the Green Party gains at the London Assembly elections next May will depend on our share of the vote: on a 5% share of the vote at the last election in 2012, we gained two 'Londonwide' seats.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">What is a Podemos ‘Circle’?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>A Podemos ‘Circle’ is a self-sustaining, community organising group without leaders, which operates open public assemblies where people debate whatever they feel is most relevant to their situation.</p>
                <p>Circles have a strong local focus, covering areas from entire cities to districts, or form around special interests (for example, there are currently circles for psychoanalysis, music and nursing).</p>
                <p>The Green Party model of Circles will be based on the five campaigning themes for London: housing, air pollution, equal pay, transport and climate change.</p>
                <p>People with a particular interest or expertise in one area will join that circle, working with others to decide on action to make progress on that issue. Actions are decided by a simple majority vote. </p>
              </dd>

              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">Why should I care about housing?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Everyone needs a home, yet more and more ordinary people - even people on very good salaries - cannot afford to live in London. The UK's capital is a place of huge housing inequality, with flats and houses treated primarily as investments, not as places to live.</p>

                <p>The Green Party wants to put people first, create more truly affordable homes, bring in controls on the rents landlords can charge, and slow down housing speculation - which is no good for the future of London or Londoners. </p>
              </dd>
              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">Why should I care about equal pay?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>London is characterised by unequal pay - the bankers' bonuses we're always hearing about never seem to trickle down enough to make a difference to the people doing less exciting but more useful work, like nurses, teachers, and those in the service industries.</p>

                <p>The Green Party wants an economy that works for everyone, where the rewards are more evenly shared. That means bringing in a London Living Wage, taxing those at the top a little bit more, and encouraging companies to introduce a 10:1 wage ratio (with no-one earning more than 10 times the least well-paid person in the organisation). </p>

                <p>This time, with nearly 12,000 Green Party members in the capital, and a really good campaign, we hope to get more. </p>
              </dd>
              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">Why should I care about air pollution?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>London has some of the dirtiest air in Europe – Oxford Street has been judged to have the worst air quality in the world. It’s so bad that we are threatened with a multi-million Euro fine from the EU Supreme Court. London’s polluted air is responsible for the premature deaths of 4,000 Londoners every year.</p>

                <p>By prioritising cleaner forms of transport, cutting emissions and creating more public spaces, the Green Party will make London a heathier, cleaner and more attractive place to live, work and play in.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">Why should I care about transport? </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>A good public transport system is essential to life in a civilised city. People and goods need to be able to move around efficiently, and that means proper public investment – not leaving things to the market.</p>

                <p>The Green Party is committed to excellent public transport in London. But we also know that the best way to get around is usually the lowest-tech option. Walking and cycling are not only very cheap; they are positively good for your health, and make roads more pleasant places to be. So we would prioritise the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over those of car drivers – making London greener, cleaner and healthier for all.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt class="tk-bebas-neue">Why should I care about climate change?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The impact of climate change will be felt in every part of the world, and by every person living on earth. Climate change has implications for our food supply, for migration to the UK, and for the sustainability of our way of life.</p>

                <p>The way cities are run, their priorities for transport, housing and water use all have huge implications for our ability to adapt to the changing climate, and ultimately to limit the negative consequences of climate change.</p>

                <p>The Green Party will urge investment in renewable technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ensure housing uses less energy, and prioritise transport that is part of the solution to climate change, not part of the problem.</p>
